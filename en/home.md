# What is RealTrainMod?
"RealTrainMod" or "RTM" is a Minecraft Java Edition railway mod developed by the Japanese creator ngt5479.

## Why RealTrainMod is Amazing
- Allows you to operate **full-scale, meticulously detailed** 3D railway vehicles
- Adds a wide range of useful items for construction and decoration, extending beyond just railways
- Users can create their own addons, freely adding content to the game
- A vibrant community continues to release various addons and related mods
- With the use of addons, the possibilities are endless!

### A Serious Explanation
The main distinction of RealTrainMod (RTM) from other railway mods is the addition of **full-scale railway vehicles**. By supporting 3D models in formats like obj and mqo, it is possible to faithfully recreate real-world railway vehicles down to the millimeter details.

Additionally, users can create their own content, such as vehicles, tracks, and other items, through the creation of [addons](/ja/addon-usage). Since RTM supports loading 3D models, content creation by users has been quite active, and many addons for various types of Japanese railway vehicles and related items have been created.

The addon system also supports advanced features using JavaScript, providing overwhelming customization options that other railway mods cannot match.

## A Rich Collection of Addons
Here’s a small preview of some of the many addons that support RealTrainMod (RTM).

They're sister cars, so it’s not a huge change, but perhaps it's the emblem effect? <a href="https://t.co/0AiJqQtqsy">pic.twitter.com/0AiJqQtqsy</a></p>&mdash; Michiru Hojyo@Minecraft (@hojyo_minecraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/hojyo_minecraft/status/1868287778649485411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>
